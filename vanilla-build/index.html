        <h3 class="bodytext">
          My programming journey began in late 2019 with Python, where I quickly
          gained proficiency. This foundational knowledge paved the way for my
          transition into game development using Unity, a platform I dedicated
          four years to mastering. In 2023, I adapted to industry changes by
          shifting to the Godot engine, focusing on self-directed learning to
          achieve mastery. This transition also allowed me to expand my
          technical skills to include GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language), enhancing
          my capabilities in advanced graphics programming. Currently, I am
          developing a personal portfolio website (the one your looking at) from
          scratch using HTML and CSS, showcasing my web development skills.
