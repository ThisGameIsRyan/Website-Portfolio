            work, intended to showcase my skills and knowledge. By exploring the

          Mathematical Concepts: The Cross Product
          <h4 class="heading4">
            Understanding Normals
            <p class="bodytext">
              A key component of mesh generation is the cross product, a
              mathematical operation essential for calculating the normals of a
              mesh. Normals, which are vectors perpendicular to the surface,
              play a crucial role in determining how light interacts with a
              surface.
            </p>
          </h4>
          <h4 class="heading4">
            From 2D to 3D
            <p class="bodytext">
              To make these concepts accessible, I begin with simple 2D
              side-view examples before transitioning to more complex 3D
              scenarios. Imagine two vectors, a and c, lying in a flat 2D plane.
              When calculating the cross product of these vectors, the result is
              a vector perpendicular to the plane they define. While this
              concept is easier to visualize in 2D as a single upward or
              downward direction, it becomes the foundation for understanding
              cross products in 3D.
            </p>
            <p class="bodytext">
              For instance, in 3D geometry, when two vectors lie on a plane and
              you compute their cross product, the resulting vector is
              perpendicular to that plane. This perpendicular vector is
              calculated using the following equations:

            </p>
            <p class="bodytext">
              When working with 3D models, such as a sphere, visible individual
              triangles can disrupt the visual smoothness. To address this, you
              can compute the average of the normal vectors at a shared vertex
              (where triangles meet). Averaging the normals results in a
              smoother appearance by softening the transitions between the
              connected triangles. After averaging, the resulting vector is
              normalized to ensure it retains unit length, preserving its
              original direction and consistency in lighting calculations.
            </p>
            <p class="bodytext">
              In 3D geometry, the process becomes more intricate due to the
              possibility of multiple intersecting planes at a single vertex.
              Each plane contributes a normal vector, and these normals must be
              averaged for the vertex. This involves iterating through the mesh,
              recalculating and normalizing the new vertex normals to replace
              the old ones. A rendering engine, often using GLSL (OpenGL Shading
              Language), interpolates between these normals across the triangle
              surfaces, creating smooth shading.
            </p>
            <p class="bodytext">
              This approach, commonly referred to as smooth lighting or smooth
              shading, enhances realism by eliminating sharp edges between
              polygons. However, in my game, which features a stylized, cartoony
              aesthetic, smooth shading isn't necessary. Instead, I implemented
              3D normal vector calculations using the cross product as shown
              above. This method aligns with the game's visual style while
              ensuring accurate geometry handling.

              My latest approach to map generation emphasizes efficiency and
              performance. By implementing a chunking technique, I can generate
              maps in segments, significantly reducing load times and enhancing
              frame rates.

              can handle complex environments with ease, achieving a frame rate
              of up to 1,500 FPS on a 1024 by 1024 map. If a chunk is behind the
              camera, it completely deletes any visual rendering information for
              that chunk, saving it into memory. If the chunk moves too far away
              from the camera, it saves the data to a file, allowing it to be
              loaded later.

            Defining Mesh Points
            <p class="bodytext">
              Defining mesh points is a critical step in the creation of a
              digital landscape. Each mesh is composed of vertices, which are
              the fundamental building blocks of 3D models. These vertices are
              defined in a coordinate system, typically using x, y, and z
              coordinates to specify their position in 3D space. The process
              begins by determining the shape and size of the mesh, which
              involves calculating the positions of each vertex. This can be
              done manually for simple shapes or algorithmically for more
              complex structures.
            </p>
            <p class="bodytext">
              Once the vertices are defined, they are connected to form edges
              and faces, creating the mesh's geometry. The precision in defining
              these points is crucial, as it affects the mesh's overall
              appearance and how it interacts with light and textures. In my
              work, I focus on ensuring that each vertex is accurately placed to
              maintain the integrity of the mesh's shape and to facilitate
              smooth rendering.

            Applying Textures
            <p class="bodytext">
              Applying textures to a mesh involves a process known as UV
              mapping, which is crucial for adding detail and realism to 3D
              models. Central to this process are the UV coordinates, which map
              the 2D texture onto the 3D model. Each vertex of the mesh is
              assigned a UV coordinate, which corresponds to a point on the
              texture. This mapping ensures that the texture aligns correctly
              with the model's geometry.
            </p>
            <p class="bodytext">
              The UV coordinates are typically represented as (U, V) pairs,
              where U and V are the horizontal and vertical axes of the texture
              map, respectively. These coordinates are crucial for determining
              how the texture is wrapped around the model. By adjusting the UV
              coordinates, you can control the scale, rotation, and position of
              the texture on the model.
